# TechnicalChallenge

Hi, This is the complete code challenge.

Remarks:

I'm short in time because I'm releasing tomorrow a product for its first release in production, so a bunch of work to do.

If had more time, I would have done more unit testing.

It's a console application, but I've made use of all the power of .net core I had enough time to implement.

It works with command-line arguments.

Examples

For Creating a Customer:
Arguments: C {name} {description} {enabled : boolean}

For adding a product to the wish list:
Arguments: A {customerId} {productId} {name} {description}

For removing a product from the wish list:
Arguments: R {productId} {customerId}

Best regards.
